In this directory please find:
  1. Listing of my working directory (screenshot): `working_directory_screenshot.png`
  2. Listing of my `hdfs` **input** directory (screenshot): `input_directory_screenshot.png`
  3. Listing of my `hdfs` **output** directory (screenshot): `output_directory_screenshot.png`
  4. The file that my reducer produces in the output directory: `part-r-00000` 
    * NOTE: This is a .txt file, with text output. Hadoop did not name this file with an extension. Mentioning in case that presents any kind of issue on your OS.
  5. My RAW command line output when running the MapReduce job, copied and saved as text file: `command_line_output_raw.txt`

  Thanks for your time,
  Tony
